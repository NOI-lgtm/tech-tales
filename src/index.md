# Hello! I'm Neer, Welcome to my digital space!

I believe accessible design has the power to improve lives, making technology intuitive and inclusive for everyone, regardless of physical abilities. This is where I write about what I learn, create, and discover every day. Itâ€™s a place to document my journey into UX, accessibility, coding and other things.
