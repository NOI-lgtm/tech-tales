  <h1>Hello, I'm Neer!</h1>
  <h2>Certified accessibility specialist, front-end developer, ux enthusiast, hobbyist inclusive designer!</h2>

I believe accessible design has the power to improve lives, making technology intuitive and inclusive for everyone, regardless of physical abilities. This is where I write about what I learn, create, and discover every day. Itâ€™s a place to document my journey into UX, accessibility, coding and digital products in general.
