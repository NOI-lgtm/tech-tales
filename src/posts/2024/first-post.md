I decided to use Eleventy after couple of thoughts and experimentation with other static site generator such as Gatsby, NextJS and etc. I read a lot of blogs and writings from the frontend and accessibility folks. Most of the accessibility, frontend design and development community has used 11ty.

Therefore, I decided to give it a try. I looked at the starter themes and I found a very interesting theme called Excellent Eleventy created by Lene Saile. And it was really nice to see a full accessible blog. So, I looked at the Github code and got inspired and decided to make a full accessible blog for myself. I am really enjoying using Eleventy.
