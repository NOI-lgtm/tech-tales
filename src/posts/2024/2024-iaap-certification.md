A year ago, I earned my IAAP Certified Professional in Accessibility Core Competencies (CPACC) certification. A milestone that marked the beginning of a deeper, more intentional journey into accessibility. The exam itself was a challenging but rewarding experience. The real value has come applying that knowledge in real projects, advocating for inclusion, and constantly learning more.
<br />
<br />

## Preparing for the CPAAC

When I first considered the certification, I had already been working on accessibility in practice — testing screen readers.

My prep plan looked something like this:

- **Studied the official IAAP Body of Knowledge**, which I treated as my primary syllabus.
- Followed a structured study schedule using flashcards, notes, and practice questions.
- Read deeply about:
  - POUR principles (Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, Robust)
  - W3C WCAG and ARIA specifications
  - Legal and policy frameworks like ADA, Section 508, and EN 301 549
- Practiced identifying accessibility barriers in everyday apps and websites.

If you’re considering taking the exam, I highly recommend mixing formal reading with real-world observation. Try using your favorite app with only a keyboard. Or a screen reader. Or in grayscale. That’s where the theory comes to life.
<br />
<br />

## Reflections and what’s next

I realized how much nuance exists in accessibility. No checklist is perfect. Real-world users break assumptions. Standards evolve. That’s the humbling part. I am contineously expanding my interest into **cognitive accessibility, internationalization, and inclusive research**.

One year in, I’m still learning. And honestly, that’s the best part. Accessibility isn’t just about rules — it’s about **people**, **context**, and **constant iteration**.

If you’re thinking about the CPACC or any IAAP certification, go for it. But don’t stop there. Certifications are mile markers, not destinations. What really matters is how you use that knowledge to **design with empathy, build with care, and advocate with clarity**.
