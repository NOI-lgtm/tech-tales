Fonts are more than just style, they’re how we understand content. The right font can improve readability and comprehension. The wrong one can make even well-written text feel confusing or inaccessible.

When I started designing my blog, I knew I wanted it to be both **visually inviting** and **accessible to as many readers as possible**.

For headings and display text, I chose **Lora** — a serif font that feels expressive and human-centered. It adds character without being distracting.

For body text, I went with **Atkinson Hyperlegible**, a font I first discovered while learning about accessibility. Designed by the **Braille Institute**, this typeface was developed specifically to support readers with low vision. It focuses on maximizing character distinction and improving comprehension, especially for people with visual impairments.

Choosing Atkinson Hyperlegible wasn’t just about accessibility — it also reads beautifully for everyone.

The goal of my font choices was simple: **let the content do the talking** — and make sure the typography doesn’t get in the way.
