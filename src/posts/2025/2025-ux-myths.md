In the world of digital product design, it’s easy to follow what sounds like best practice. But many widely shared beliefs like “users don’t scroll” or “accessibility is too costly” aren’t backed by evidence. UXMyths.com compiles and debunks these common misconceptions using usability studies and real-world data. Here’s a look at a few myths that frequently lead teams astray, especially around user behavior and accessibility.

<br>

## 🚫 UX Myths That Still Mislead

<br>

### **Myth: Users read all the text**

Most users don’t read every word. They scan—looking for headings, keywords, and actionable elements. Studies show less than 20% of content is typically read on a page.

**Better approach:** Present information in short, digestible sections. Use clear headings, bulleted lists, and bold text to highlight key points.

<br>

<br>

### **Myth: People don’t scroll**

Contrary to this belief, users do scroll—often more than expected—when content feels relevant and well organized. Long pages, when structured thoughtfully, can increase engagement and usability.

**Better approach:** Use visual indicators, logical layout, and scannable content to encourage exploration down the page.

### **Myth: Accessibility is too complex or expensive**

Accessibility isn’t a luxury—it’s a baseline for inclusive design. And it doesn’t require large budgets or extensive resources. Many improvements, like proper heading structure, alt text, and contrast checking, can be implemented early with minimal effort.

**Better approach:** Integrate accessibility from the start with semantic HTML, keyboard support, sufficient color contrast, and screen reader-friendly elements.

### **Myth: Accessible design limits visual creativity**

Designs that are accessible can be just as visually polished and brand-consistent. Accessibility and aesthetics are not mutually exclusive—many of the best-designed products are also highly inclusive.

**Better approach:** Combine accessible patterns with refined typography, color systems, and layout. Inclusive design leads to cleaner, more thoughtful interfaces.

### **Myth: Experts don’t need to test their designs**

Expertise is valuable—but it doesn’t replace testing. Even the most experienced designers can overlook usability issues. Testing with users often reveals unexpected behaviors that no amount of theory can predict.

**Better approach:** Test early and often, even if it's informal. Just a few sessions with real users can uncover problems that internal reviews miss.

## 🧠 Why It Matters

Relying on unproven assumptions leads to friction, confusion, and lost trust. When digital experiences are based on research and inclusive thinking, they perform better—for everyone.

UXMyths.com provides a solid reminder: **good UX comes from understanding actual behavior, not guessing.** It encourages teams to validate ideas with evidence—and to include accessibility and user input as foundational, not optional.

## 🔍 Final Takeaway

- Scanning is the norm, not reading.
- Scrolling is expected—if the layout supports it.
- Accessibility isn't optional or expensive—it's essential.
- Good design is inclusive design.

Before falling back on what “sounds right,” it’s worth pausing to ask: _Is this based on user behavior or assumption?_

Better products begin with better questions—and better evidence.
