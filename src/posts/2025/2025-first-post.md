With the new year underway, I started setting up a new folder structure for this yearâ€™s blog posts. Up until now, Iâ€™d only worked with starter templates. This time, I wanted to try building from scratch â€” and that led me to dig deeper into how Eleventy handles categorized content.

I started by exploring the **Collection API** in Eleventy. The documentation was helpful, and I realized that for my current needs, I didnâ€™t need to mess with tags or complex metadata. Just organizing content by folder and pointing the Collection API to the right path did the job.

It was surprisingly simple. No fancy setup, just a few lines in `eleventy.config.js`, and everything was sorted and rendered the way I wanted. It was a small win, but a meaningful one â€” being able to structure content cleanly without relying on external templates.
