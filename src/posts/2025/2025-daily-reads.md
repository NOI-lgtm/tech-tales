## üåê Key Topics Explored Today

<br>

### 1. **Label Placement in Web Forms**

**Source**: [Nielsen Norman Group ‚Äì Placeholders in Form Fields](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/form-design-placeholders/)

**Summary**:
Placeholders should not replace labels. Screen readers often skip placeholders, and users forget them after typing. Labels should be persistent, visible, and placed either above or to the left of the input for maximum readability.

**My Takeaway**:
I‚Äôll explore using floating labels sparingly and always ensure labels are programmatically associated with inputs using `for` and `id`.

### 2. **Field Length Affordance**

**Source**: [Luke Wroblewski ‚Äì Input Field Length](https://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?1083)

**Summary**:
The visible length of a field can communicate the expected input. For example, a short field suggests a short entry like a ZIP code.

**My Takeaway**:
Visual affordances help guide users. In tomorrow‚Äôs experiment, I‚Äôll mock up a checkout form with this principle applied.

### 3. **Error Messaging Best Practices**

**Source**: [Gov.uk Design System ‚Äì Error Messages](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/error-message/)

**Summary**:
Errors should be clear, polite, and point to how to fix the issue. Highlight errors at the top of the form and inline next to the field.

**My Takeaway**:
I‚Äôll revise an old form design with inline validation and use ARIA `aria-describedby` for accessibility.
