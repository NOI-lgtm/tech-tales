# Choosing accessible font for my blog

Fonts are the window for understanding the text. It can make or break the mental model of readability. If fonts are not eligible the purpose and meaning of the text gets lost.

For heading and display font, I choose Lora a human centric, creative and expressive font. And for body text I decided to use Atkinson Hyperlegible font. I had heard about this font when I was learning about accessibility. And Atkinson Hyperlegible font came from Braille Institute. It was developed specifically to increase legibility for readers with low vision, and to improve comprehension. [More about Atkinson Hyperlegible](https://www.brailleinstitute.org/freefont/)
